Tracking exercises from Learn Python the Hard Way

Author: Dominic Hartjes

  The semester after I took my Programming Logic and Design Class at Minneapolis Community and Technical College the teachers added python as the primarily language of the class. I had learned the class with pseudo-code and UML. Feeling robbed, I started studying Python on my own in 2014. I highly recommend Zed Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way" if you are getting started with programming and have chosen Python as your first language.

Happy programming!
